#  READ BEFORE INT!!! :3 
(Basically what to expect)

- Socially awkward af. Means that I am not ignoring you randomly, I'm just not sure how to continue the conversation. I only really get chatty with people I know, but if a person needs help with something I will still try my best to help.

- I have... **a lot** of ocs, mainly for selfship reasons. If you don't like that, it's honestly better for you to hide me.

- Please, if you see I am talking with someone and it's chaotic, otherwise occupied or even see in my name that I am AFK - whisper to me instead. Some people don't get it and then get mad for no reason.

- If we don't know eachother too good use tone tags with me! It helps me sm more to understand the meaning behind your words.

- Despite being aroace I might make sexual jokes or even flirt. This is **purely** platonic on my part. The flirting doesn't mean anything. Sorry not sorry.

- I say a lot of out of pocket stuff sometimes when I get comfy, sometimes they're even horrendous, but I swear it's all in good fun and I'm not actually serious.
