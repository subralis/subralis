#  READ BEFORE INT!!! „Äú‚Å†(‚Å†Íí™‚Å†Íí≥‚Å†Íí™‚Å†)‚Å†„Äú
(Basically what to expect)

- Socially awkward af. Means that I am not ignoring you randomly, I'm just not sure how to continue the conversation. I only really get chatty with people I know, but if a person needs help with something I will still try my best to help.

- I have... **a lot** of ocs, mainly for selfship reasons. If you don't like that, it's honestly better for you to hide me.

- Please, if you see I am talking with someone and it's chaotic, otherwise occupied or even see in my name that I am AFK - whisper to me instead. Some people don't get it and then get mad for no reason.

- If we don't know eachother too good use tone tags/indicators with me! It helps me sm more to understand the meaning behind your words. Especially since if I somehow without the tone tags perceive your tone as passive aggressive, it will cause me to start ignoring you, avoiding you or talking less, if not bite back at what I think is an attempt at a personal attack on me. Tone indicators are such a small thing yet help IMMENSELY. People on this game can be seriously mean and insensitive sometimes, to the point it's impossible be sure whether someone is joking or actually serious.

- Despite being aroace I might make sexual jokes or even flirt. This is **purely** platonic on my part. The flirting doesn't mean anything. Sorry not sorry. I also don't take serious flirting towards my person, it makes me uncomfy. Jokingly flirting is okay if we're friends or close. 

- I say a lot of out of pocket stuff sometimes when I get comfy, sometimes they're even horrendous, but I swear it's all in good fun and I'm not actually serious.

- If I have somehow offended you, said something mean despite us getting along prior - explain this fact to me. Don't immidiately jump into insults or see it as a personal attack when it's likely either me being joking or a misunderstanding. Something I can easily correct/clarify or apologize for.

- Similarly so if I accidentally crossed a boundary of yours, tell me. I will apologize and note not to do it again.

- I don't like people dragging me into their drama for no reason or when I got nothing to do with it (mainly applied to strangers).

- I don't like being dragged into roleplays, especially romantic canon x OC ones. No, I won't sit as your fav character you ship your OC with and act lovey dovey with you. Find someone else to do that. I only let it slide with my close friends.


  # INT IF! ‡∏Ö‚Å†^‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†Ôªå‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†^‚Å†‡∏Ö

  - Fellow self shipper or CANON X OC likers/havers. 
  - You are into any of the fandoms from the skins I am using and want to chat a bit about it.
  - Skins of: MK1 Bi-Han (Sub-Zero, Titan or Noob), any DMC Vergil skin, Aatrox from LoL skins, Albert Wesker skins, Sephiroth skins, L&DS Sylus skins, DBD Trickster skins, Leon from **pokemon** skins, Alice Asylum/Madness Returns etc. skins, Winx Club skins, Homicipher skins, MCU skins, Jason Todd/Red Hood/Arkham Knight skins and more.

 # DNI IF! (general dni criteria + specific)

 - **Minors.** I don't care how mature for your age you think you are. I will literally report you if I spot you in 18+ server. The very tiny exception is if you're close to 18 years old. Minors shouldn't invade adult spaces then cry about seeing adult topics being used and screaming "pedo!!". Yes, people on this game actually do that. I also have bad history with encountering minors on this game and I am not going to sacrifice my comfort because you wanna act all grown up and cool.

- **"This character solos that OC!!", "No, (insert character) won't care about your OC!! Don't ship them together!", "OCS ARE CRINGE!!"** Idgaf bro. Stop yapping. Let me be autistic and obsess over my fav characters and make them kiss in peace. It's just pixels on a screen. Attractive pixels, but still pixels. It ain't that deep. Go shower, u stink. 

- **RDR2 FANDOM.** Blocking you immidiately as soon as I see you as an rdr2 pony on my screen. Too much of a bad history with this fandom. I don't care how chill you say you are, sorry. It's for personal reasons. The fandom sadly mainly stinks...

- **toxic sefikura stans.** I don't have a problem with the ship itself, only people shipping it. Mainly the fact some of y'all treat this ship like some godly thing that all people have to agree with or else they're getting dogpiled by angry stans simply because they respectfully don't agree with it.

- **coffin of andy and leyley fandom.** It's not even *only* about the incest scene, it's about the game as a whole. It has other weird stuff in it on top of the incest.

- **okegom fandom** it's scary how quick y'all are to ship and approve of rapist x victim ships, just because the rapist acts cutesy or charming, and the victim's trauma is made a joke even by the author or heavily downplayed/ignored.

- **genshin fandom**. Particularly the people afraid of melanin or those purposefully changing characters that are actually meant to be pale skinned, or it's relevant to character that they are, into other ethnicities.

- **helluva boss/hazbin hotel fandom** unless you're already on my friend list. The show is... Eh, the writing is ass. The fandom is worse. Especially if y'all are Alastor simps, or Valentino simps/apologists, same for Andrealphus stans.

- **Vivziepop** supporters. She's problematic and there's no point in hiding that.

- **spardacest.** No, we don't ship siblings in this household, nor do we ship father x son or uncle x nephew.

- **those types of infantilized, cutesy OCS or oversexualized OCs that you ship with literal grown ass men.** I don't mind if an OC has pastel clothes, dresses cute, is short or all three. The problem starts when the OC behaves/acts or dresses as a child and gets treated like one by the person they're shipped with. Also those oversexualized COD OCs that are shipped ALWAYS with Ghost and K√∂nig.

- Trolls, any form of ragebait, hitler ponies, stalin ponies, jeffrey dahmer ponies, anti-furry, obsessive christians, incest defenders, minor x adult shippers, lolicons, proshippers in general, zoophiles,homophobic/straightphobic/transphobic/xenophobic/racist.

  ***(NOTE: This list will be updated depending on future events and so on.)***
